\subsection{Motivation and Historical Development}
\subsubsection{The Central Role of Light in Science and Technology}

Light is far more than a mere object of study—it is a universal information carrier\index{information carrier (light)}, a precise tool, and a fundamental link between theory and measurement. In a sense, light is the “eye of physics”: without it, we could neither look into the cosmos nor into the inner structure of matter.

\subsubsection*{Light as a Means of Knowledge – From Telescope to Particle Accelerator}
\phantomsection
Astronomy\index{astronomy} would be unthinkable without light. With Galileo’s telescope, the observation of celestial bodies in visible light began. The development of spectroscopy,\index{spectroscopy} radio telescopes\index{radio telescope}, and X-ray detectors\index{X-ray detector} revealed that every celestial object emits radiation, telling us its temperature, composition, and motion. Light is the only messenger that reliably reaches us across billions of light-years.

At the other extreme, probing the smallest dimensions also requires light. Microscopy\index{microscopy}—whether with visible light, electrons, or lasers—has opened up an entire hidden world: cells, DNA, atoms. Modern techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy\index{scanning tunneling microscopy} or optical tweezers\index{optical tweezers} rely on the controlled interaction of light with matter on the smallest scales.

\subsubsection*{Light in Technology – From Everyday Use to High Precision}
\phantomsection
Technologically, light has become the central medium. Communication via fiber optics\index{fiber optics} would be impossible without coherent, low-loss light—terabit data streams circle the globe daily as modulated light pulses. In laser technology\index{laser} too, light plays a key role: from CD players to precision material processing and laser surgery\index{laser surgery}, energy and information are controlled by light.

Navigation and timekeeping also rely on light: GPS\index{GPS} signals depend on clocks calibrated with lasers, and the most precise clocks in the world—optical lattice clocks\index{optical clock}—tick with light frequencies.

\subsubsection*{Light as a Measuring Instrument – Universal and Contact-Free}
\phantomsection
Light enables non-contact measurement. In spectroscopy, for example, light is used to determine the chemical composition of gases, liquids, and solids—from stellar atmospheres to quality control in industry.

Temperature can also be measured via light, using Planck’s radiation law\index{Planck’s radiation law}. Motion can be determined with the Doppler effect\index{Doppler effect}, distances with laser interferometry\index{laser interferometry}. Gravitational waves\index{gravitational waves}, first detected in 2015, left their trace in the distance between two mirrors—measured with light to a precision of one-thousandth of a proton diameter.

\subsubsection*{Light as a Theoretical Foundation}
\phantomsection
In theoretical physics, light is the prime example of fields, quanta, and interactions. Classical electrodynamics\index{electrodynamics, classical} describes light as a wave; quantum electrodynamics describes it as an exchange of light quanta\index{light quantum}. The relativistic structure of spacetime is tightly connected to the constancy of the speed of light\index{speed of light}—light is not just a phenomenon but a structural element of the laws of nature.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\phantomsection
\emph{Light is simultaneously a tool, an information carrier, a natural law, and an object of research.} In hardly any other area of physics do theory and practice intertwine as deeply as in the study of light. It opens our view into the universe—and at the same time into the heart of matter. In technology, it brings precision, speed, and new possibilities. It rightly stands at the center of modern science.

\subsection{Wave-Particle Dualism}\index{wave-particle dualism}

A central result of modern physics is the realization that light (and in general, quantum objects) cannot be described solely as a wave or as a particle. Instead, it exhibits a \emph{wave-particle dualism}: depending on the experiment, light appears either as an electromagnetic wave with interference and diffraction patterns (e.g., in the double-slit experiment\index{double-slit experiment}), or as a stream of light quanta, called photons (e.g., in the photoelectric effect\index{photoelectric effect}).

This behavior contradicts classical intuition, where waves and particles are strictly separate concepts. In quantum physics, however, they are two complementary aspects of the same physical phenomenon. The mathematical description of this dualism requires a fundamental reformulation of physics: the classical trajectory of a particle is replaced by the wave function\index{wave function}, whose squared modulus gives the probability distribution. This marks the beginning of quantum mechanics.

Wave-particle dualism is not a lack of knowledge but a deeper property of nature, confirmed experimentally and generalized mathematically by quantum field theory.

\subsection{The Photon Concept in the New Worldview of Quantum Mechanics}

\subsubsection{From the Classical Concept of Light to the Quantum Revolution}

In classical physics, light was understood either as particles (Newton)\index{Newton, Isaac} or as waves (Huygens, later Maxwell)\index{Huygens, Christiaan}\index{Maxwell, James Clerk}. With Maxwell’s equations, one had an elegant theory of electromagnetic waves that fully explained light as a wave phenomenon. A particle character seemed unnecessary.

But at the end of the 19th century, this worldview began to crumble. The attempt to explain the radiation spectrum of black bodies with classical physics led to the so-called \emph{ultraviolet catastrophe}\index{ultraviolet catastrophe}. The Rayleigh–Jeans law\index{Rayleigh–Jeans law} predicted an unphysical divergence of energy at high frequencies.

\subsubsection{Planck’s Quantization Idea}

Max Planck (1900)\index{Planck, Max} found a way out by postulating that energy is not emitted continuously but only in discrete units:
\begin{equation}
	E = n h f, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
Here $h$ is Planck’s constant\index{Planck’s constant} and $f$ the frequency of the radiation.

\subsubsection{Einstein’s Light Quantum Hypothesis}

In 1905, Albert Einstein interpreted Planck’s assumption more radically: light consists of \emph{discrete energy packets}, called \textbf{light quanta} or \textbf{photons}, each carrying an energy of
\begin{equation}
	E_\gamma = h f
\end{equation}
\index{light quantum}
He thereby explained the \emph{photoelectric effect}, in which electrons are emitted from a metal only if the frequency of the light exceeds a certain threshold—independent of light intensity.

This insight challenged the classical wave picture and laid the foundation for a new understanding of light.

\subsubsection{Wave-Particle Dualism of the Photon}

Modern experiments, such as the double-slit experiment with single photons, clearly show: photons behave both like particles and like waves. They produce localized momentum transfer in individual detections, but interference patterns collectively.

A photon has:
\begin{itemize}
	\item energy $E = h f$\index{energy}
	\item momentum $p = \dfrac{h}{\lambda}$\index{momentum}
	\item no rest mass\index{rest mass}
	\item constant speed $c$ in vacuum
\end{itemize}
(A detailed derivation of the photon’s energy and momentum relations can be found in Appendix~A, Section~\ref{anhangA:energie_impuls}.)

\subsubsection{Photons in Quantum Electrodynamics\newline (QED)}

In quantized field theory, the photon is understood as an \emph{excitation of the electromagnetic field}\index{electromagnetic field}. It is the interaction particle of the electromagnetic force, a so-called \emph{exchange particle}\index{exchange particle} in the framework of quantum field theory.

The photon:
\begin{itemize}
	\item is massless but has spin $1$\index{spin}
	\item has no well-defined position in the classical sense
	\item exists only as a \emph{detection event} in the measurement process
\end{itemize}
(The mathematical description of the electromagnetic field, including the field strength tensor and Lagrangian density, is given in Appendix~A; see Section~\ref{anhangA:feldtheorie}.)

\subsubsection{Worldview Shift Through the Photon}

The photon concept transcends the limits of classical ideas and exemplifies the central paradigms of quantum mechanics:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Physical quantities are often not continuous but quantized\index{quantization}.
	\item Measurement\index{measurement (quantum physics)} alters the system and brings out certain properties.
	\item Wave and particle are not opposites but complementary descriptions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[didaktikbox, title=Quantum Object Instead of Light Ball]
	\label{box:lichtkugel}
	\emph{“The photon is not a light ball but a quantum object—defined not by being, but by happening.”}\footnote{Paraphrased, inspired by modern interpretations such as Zeilinger [15].}
	
	This quote captures the change in worldview: the photon is not a classical object but an event that becomes concrete only through measurement. It embodies interaction rather than substance—one of the deepest insights of quantum mechanics.
\end{tcolorbox}
\index{Zeilinger, Anton}

\subsubsection{Outlook and Applications}

Photons play a central role today in numerous fields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Photonics:} light as information and energy carrier in technology\index{photonics}
	\item \emph{Laser physics:} stimulated emission of coherent photons\index{laser physics}
	\item \emph{Quantum optics:} single-photon sources, entanglement, teleportation\index{quantum optics}
	\item \emph{Quantum cryptography:} secure communication through photon states\index{quantum cryptography}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Philosophical Reflections on the Photon Concept}

The photon concept has changed not only our physical but also our philosophical worldview. Several great thinkers of quantum physics have expressed this shift concisely:

\begin{tcolorbox}[didaktikbox, title=What Is Reality in Quantum Physics?]
	\label{box:realitaet}
	“There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum theory.” – \textbf{Niels Bohr} \cite{bohr1934} \\
	“Quantum theory has taught us that we cannot ascribe properties to nature without considering the act of observation.” – \textbf{Werner Heisenberg} \cite{heisenberg1959} \\
	“The photon is pure information—it exists only when it interacts with the world.” – \textbf{Anton Zeilinger} \cite{zeilinger2005}
\end{tcolorbox}
\index{Heisenberg, Werner}

These statements underline: the photon is not a material particle in the classical sense, but a quantum event—something that becomes concrete only through measurement. The classical notion of a well-defined object is replaced by a probabilistic description in space, time, and interaction.

\subsection{Methodology and Experiments: Making the Invisible Visible}\index{experiment (physics)}

The idea that light consists of tiny portions of energy—so-called photons—may seem obvious today. But how can such a thing be measured? How can we prove something that is so small and fleeting that it has no fixed form?

Indeed, the path from theory to measurement in the case of the photon is particularly fascinating. Quantum physics shows us that light is not simply “seen”—it only becomes evident in its interaction with matter.

\subsubsection{The Single Photon: When Light Clicks}
Imagine darkening a room completely and firing just one single light particle onto a highly sensitive surface. There—if everything works—\newline \textbf{it clicks}: an electrical pulse occurs, triggered by exactly this one photon.

Such detectors really exist. They are called \textit{single-photon detectors}\index{single-photon detector} and can count individual photons. Particularly sensitive devices—so-called \textit{avalanche detectors}\index{avalanche detector}—trigger a small electron avalanche when hit by a photon, turning a tiny event into a measurable signal.
\vspace{1em}
\begin{tcolorbox}[physikbox, title=The Single Photon – When It Clicks]
	\label{box:einzelphoton}
	A photon can be detected individually—by detectors so sensitive that they react to a single quantum of light.
	
	When a photon strikes the active surface, it produces a measurable electrical signal. This “click” is the direct evidence of a single photon—and thus proof of its particle character.
	
	Particularly sensitive devices, such as avalanche photodiodes or superconducting detectors, count photons individually. This technology underpins modern quantum optics.
\end{tcolorbox}
\newpage
\noindent
\subsubsection{Double-Slit: The Magic of Many Singles}
A famous experiment demonstrates the dual nature of the photon most impressively: the double-slit experiment\index{double-slit experiment}. Photons are sent one by one through a wall with two slits. Each individual photon strikes the screen seemingly at random. But after many hits, an interference pattern emerges—as if all photons had gone through both slits simultaneously and interfered with each other.

How is this possible? Quantum physics says: each photon \emph{behaves like a wave} as long as it is not observed—and like a particle when detected. It is both—or, more accurately, something entirely new beyond classical categories.

\subsubsection{When Two Photons Know More Than One}
Things become even stranger when two photons are produced at the same time—so-called \textit{entangled photon pairs}\index{entanglement}. Measuring one immediately fixes the state of the other—even if it is far away.

Such experiments show that the microscopic world does not work as our everyday intuition suggests. Cause and effect, space and time—all acquire new meaning. Physics speaks here of \textit{entanglement} and \textit{nonclassicality}. For us, it means: nature is deeper, more interconnected, and more surprising than we ever imagined.

\begin{tcolorbox}[didaktikbox, title=What Does Entanglement Mean?]
	\label{box:verschr}
	Two entangled photons form a joint quantum system—their properties cannot be defined independently.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Measuring one photon immediately determines the state of the other—regardless of distance.
		\item There is no hidden classical information—the correlation arises only upon measurement.
		\item The “knowledge” is not in a single photon but in the entirety of the entangled system.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This quantum connection contradicts the classical notion of local forces—and has been confirmed in many experiments.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[physikbox, title=How Are Entangled Photons Produced?]
	\label{box:spdc}
	In quantum optics, entangled photons are usually produced using nonlinear crystals—for example, by \emph{spontaneous parametric down-conversion} (SPDC)\index{spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)}.
	
	A single high-energy photon (pump laser) strikes a special crystal. With small probability, a pair of lower-energy photons is created, conserving momentum and energy.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item These two photons are entangled—for example, in polarization state.
		\item The result is not a “decay” in the classical sense, but a quantum coupling of two states.
		\item The photons move in opposite directions, allowing them to be analyzed separately.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This technique underpins modern experiments on quantum entanglement, Bell tests, and quantum communication.
\end{tcolorbox}
(A formal description of entangled states using Dirac notation can be found in Appendix~A, Section~\ref{anhangA:verschr}.)

\subsubsection{The Meaning of the Experiments}
\label{box:experimente}
\begin{tcolorbox}[didaktikbox, title=What the Experiments Teach Us]
	These experiments did more than confirm the photon concept—they revolutionized our worldview.
	
	Photons show that nature cannot always be forced into clear categories like “wave” or “particle.” They show that measurement and observation play a deeper role than previously thought. And they open the door to technologies such as quantum computers\index{quantum computer}, quantum cryptography, and ultrafast light switches.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

What we know about light today is owed to a combination of theory and experimental skill. Without modern detectors, precise timekeeping, and clever setups, we could only talk about photons—but not know that they truly exist. Experiments are the proof: the photon is no fantasy, but a building block of reality—and at the same time a window into a world full of mysteries yet to be uncovered.

\begin{tcolorbox}[didaktikbox, title=What We Take Away from Chapter I]
	\label{box:kapitel1faz}
	The photon is not a theoretical construct—it is real, measurable, and confirmed by experiments.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It has no mass but does carry energy and momentum.
		\item It shows wave and particle properties—depending on the experiment.
		\item It is indivisible, but not a classical “little ball.”
		\item It stands at the beginning of many modern technologies (lasers, quantum cryptography, light detection).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The photon is the prototype of a quantum object—it forces us to rethink reality, information, and measurement.
\end{tcolorbox}
